# A data set for a particular model has a large number of features. We suspect that not all of them are useful.
# Gathering the feature scores for the resulting model has confirmed our suspicions. Feature extraction for
# this data set takes a long time but training the model is fairly quick. We need to deliver the model soon, so we've
# decided to just remove from the data set the features that have no value, and then retrain the model.
#
# This script removes all feature data which has been found to add no value. It takes a file containing the original
# feature data and, using a file containing scores for each feature with a score > 0, creates a new feature file with
# the masked feature data.
#
# Assumptions about the feature data:
# 1. Feature data row format is a comma-separated list:
#           ID, label, feature 0 value,..., feature n value
#    where all feature values are float
# 2. All rows have the same number of values
# 3. The resulting output file must contain the ID and label in addition to the masked features
#
# Assumptions about the feature score data:
# 1. A feature score row is of the following format:
#       f<0-based feature number> <score>
#   For example:
#       f590 1912.0991193927057
# 2. Only features with a non-zero score will be present in the file
# 3. The rows in the file are ordered by highest-scoring feature to lowest non-zero-scoring feature
